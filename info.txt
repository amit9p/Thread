Subject: Farewell and Thank You!

Dear Team,

As I bid adieu to this amazing team and project, I want to express my deep gratitude for the incredible experience. Working on Snowflake, DBT, Sprinklr, and SDP for the past 6 months has been a remarkable journey filled with learning and growth.

A special thanks to Vin, Justin (our product owner), and my supportive team members - Sean, Jinal, Pavan, and Venesa. Your guidance and collaboration have been invaluable.

While I'm excited about the next chapter, I will carry the memories and skills gained here with me. Keep in touch!

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
