Feature: Ad-hoc Execution of Stored Procedure due to Job Failure

  As a database administrator
  I want to call the stored procedure ad-hoc
  So that I can address job failures without waiting for the next scheduled run

  Background:
    Given I have access to the database system
    And the stored procedure "ProcessJob" exists
    And there has been a recent job failure

  Scenario: Execute Stored Procedure Ad-hoc After Job Failure
    Given I am connected to the database
    When I execute the stored procedure "ProcessJob"
    Then the stored procedure should execute successfully
    And the results should be stored in the database

  Scenario: Notify Relevant Parties After Successful Ad-hoc Execution
    Given the stored procedure "ProcessJob" has executed successfully ad-hoc
    When the execution completes
    Then a notification should be sent to the relevant parties about the successful execution

  Scenario: Handle Failure of Ad-hoc Execution
    Given I am connected to the database
    When I attempt to execute the stored procedure "ProcessJob" and it fails
    Then an error message should be displayed
    And a log entry should be made detailing the failure
    And a notification should be sent to the system administrator
