-- Assuming you have a stored procedure named `my_procedure` which returns 1 on success and 0 on failure

-- Initial Task
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK my_task
WAREHOUSE = mywarehouse
SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON ...'
AS
CALL my_procedure();

-- Retry Task 1 (Retry after 1 hour, for example)
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK my_task_retry1
WAREHOUSE = mywarehouse
AFTER my_task
WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('...') -- Condition to check if the previous task failed
AS
CALL my_procedure();

-- You can create more retry tasks with similar logic and increasing delays
