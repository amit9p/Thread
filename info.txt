File Format Issues: Occasionally, the way the file is read might cause Snowflake to misinterpret the number of columns. This could be due to irregularities in how data is delimited or newline characters are handled.

Network or Storage Glitches: Infrequent glitches in network or storage (especially if the file is on cloud storage like S3) can cause incomplete or incorrect file reads.
